This project started after one of those classic meetings where "simple resume parsing" mysteriously evolved into "enterprise-grade candidate matching with AI predictions." Instead of building yet another janky one-off script, I figured why not create a proper architecture that can actually handle whatever random requirements get tossed in next week? So here's ResuMariner - a solid microservice setup with Neo4j, Qdrant, and various APIs for handling CVs that can grow from "just extract the text" to "find me candidates with 7+ years React who once thought about learning Rust and might enjoy ping-pong" without needing a complete rewrite.
## ‚ú® Features

- **CV Upload and Processing**: Upload CV documents (PDF, DOCX, JPG) for automated parsing and analysis
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Extract key information from CVs into a structured format
- **CV Review Generation**: Generate professional reviews of candidate CVs
- **Semantic Search**: Find candidates based on natural language queries
- **Structured Search**: Search candidates by specific criteria (skills, experience, etc.)
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine semantic and structured search for optimal results
- **Secure Architecture**: Separation between public-facing and internal services

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

ResuMariner follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

![sys_diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6415793d-88c4-46a4-bac0-6ba177c90da9)

- **Traefik**: Reverse proxy and API gateway
- **cv-intake-service**: Handles CV file uploads and job management
- **cv-processing-service**: Processes and analyzes CV documents using LLMs
- **cv-storage-service**: Manages persistent storage of CV data
- **cv-search-service**: Provides advanced search capabilities
- **Databases**:
  - **Neo4j**: Graph database for structured CV data
  - **Qdrant**: Vector database for semantic search embeddings
  - **Redis**: Job queue and caching

The system is split between a public network zone (accessible from outside) and a protected internal network zone.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- At least 4GB of RAM for running all services
- API keys for LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) if using those services (only one is enough)

### Deployment

Deployment is straightforward:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

That's it! The system will be available at the following endpoints:

- CV Upload: http://intake.localhost
- CV Search: http://search.localhost
- Traefik Dashboard: http://traefik.localhost

## üìã API Documentation

### Upload API (intake.localhost)

- POST `/api/v1/upload`: Upload a CV file for processing
- GET `/api/v1/status/{job_id}`: Check processing status
- GET `/api/v1/results/{job_id}`: Get processing results

### Search API (search.localhost)

- POST `/search/semantic`: Semantic search using natural language
- POST `/search/structured`: Structured search using specific criteria
- POST `/search/hybrid`: Combined semantic and structured search
- GET `/filters`: Get available filter options

## üß™ Testing

The system includes a comprehensive testing script that can process a CV and run various searches against it:

```bash 
python test_script.py path/to/resume.pdf
```

Calling 

```bash 
python test_script.py 
```

Will return result for existing CV in `./test_inputs` folder, namely `./test_inputs/Max_Azatian.pdf`.

Additional flags are to be found in [test_script.py](test_script.py).
